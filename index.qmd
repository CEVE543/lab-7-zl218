## Background and Goals

Climate models have systematic biases that directly affect impact assessments, arising from coarse spatial resolution, parameterization of sub-grid processes, representation of topography, and errors in simulated circulation patterns.
This lab implements two widely-used bias correction approaches: the delta method and quantile-quantile (QQ) mapping.
The delta method preserves the climate model's change signal while anchoring absolute values to observations, whereas QQ-mapping corrects the full distribution of values.

Both methods assume stationarity—that the statistical relationship between model and observations remains constant across climate states.
This assumption may not hold under significant climate change.
We'll explore the strengths and limitations of each method using temperature data for Boston, providing hands-on experience before PS2 Part 1.

## Study Location and Data

This lab uses temperature data for Boston Logan International Airport (Station ID: USW00014739, 42.3631$^\circ$N, 71.0064$^\circ$W).
Observational data comes from GHCN-Daily (1936-2024) and is provided in the `USW00014739.csv` file in degrees Celsius.
Climate model data comes from the GFDL-ESM4 model's 3-hourly near-surface air temperature (`tas`), pre-downloaded from Google Cloud Storage for both historical (1850-2014) and SSP3-7.0 (2015-2100) scenarios.
Refer to [Lab 6](/labs/Lab-6/index.qmd) for details on CMIP6 data structure.

### Data Processing Notes

The GHCN data provides daily average temperature in degrees Celsius.
CMIP6 provides 3-hourly instantaneous temperature in Kelvin, which we'll convert to Celsius and aggregate to daily averages.
The pre-downloaded NetCDF files (`boston_historical.nc` and `boston_ssp370.nc`) contain 3-hourly surface air temperature for the grid cell nearest to Boston.
We aggregate 8 consecutive 3-hour periods to approximate daily averages, ignoring daylight saving time—a simplification typical in many bias correction applications.
If you're interested in applying these methods to a different location, the `download_data.jl` script demonstrates how to extract CMIP6 data from Google Cloud Storage.

## Before Starting

Before starting the lab, uncomment the `Pkg.instantiate()` line in the first code block and run it to install all required packages.
This will take a few minutes the first time.
After installation completes, comment the line back out to avoid reinstalling on subsequent runs.

## Lab Implementation

### Package Setup

```{julia}
#| output: false
using Pkg
lab_dir = dirname(@__FILE__)
Pkg.activate(lab_dir)
# Pkg.instantiate() # uncomment this the first time you run the lab to install packages, then comment it back
```

```{julia}
#| output: false
using CSV, CairoMakie, DataFrames, Dates, LaTeXStrings, NCDatasets, Statistics, StatsBase, TidierData
ENV["DATAFRAMES_ROWS"] = 6
CairoMakie.activate!()

# Constants for plotting
const MONTH_NAMES = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
const MONTH_LABELS = (1:12, MONTH_NAMES)
```

### Task 1: Load and Process Data

We begin by loading both observational and climate model data.
The observational data from GHCN-Daily spans 1936-2024, while the CMIP6 data requires processing from 3-hourly to daily resolution.
We'll use the overlapping historical period (1995-2014) to calibrate bias corrections.

::: {.callout-important}
## Instructions

Load the Boston GHCN temperature data from `USW00014739.csv` and filter to years with at least 80% complete data.
Then load the pre-downloaded CMIP6 NetCDF files and aggregate the 3-hourly temperature data to daily values for the historical (1995-2014) and near-term future (2020-2040) periods.
The helper functions `load_cmip6_data()` and `aggregate_to_daily()` are provided below.
Finally, visualize the annual cycle comparing observations vs the historical GCM simulation.

### Task 2: Implement Delta Method

The delta method corrects the mean bias while preserving the climate model's projected change signal.
We calculate a monthly bias correction based on the historical period (1995-2014) and apply it to future projections.

::: {.callout-important}
## Instructions

Implement the additive delta method for temperature bias correction.
For each calendar month $m$, calculate the mean bias: $\Delta_m = \bar{T}^\text{GCM}_{\text{hist},m} - \bar{T}^\text{obs}_{\text{hist},m}$.
Then apply the correction to future values: $T^\text{corr}_{\text{fut}}(d, m, y) = T^\text{GCM}_{\text{fut}}(d, m, y) - \Delta_m$.

Follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly mean bias by grouping both `df_gcm_hist` and `df_obs_hist` by month, computing their means, joining them, and computing the difference.
2. Create a bar plot visualizing the monthly bias.
3. Write a function `apply_delta_method(gcm_temps, gcm_dates, monthly_bias_df)` that applies the bias correction to a vector of temperatures and dates.
4. Apply your function to the near-term data and add a new column `temp_delta` to `df_ssp370_near`.
5. Create monthly climatologies for both raw and delta-corrected near-term data.
6. Visualize the annual cycle showing historical observations, raw GCM near-term, and delta-corrected near-term temperatures.

```

### Task 3: Implement Quantile-Quantile Mapping

Unlike the delta method, QQ-mapping transforms the entire probability distribution of model output to match observations.
For each value in the future model output, we find its percentile in the historical model distribution, then map it to the same percentile in the historical observed distribution.

::: {.callout-important}
## Instructions

Implement QQ-mapping to correct the full distribution of temperature values.

Follow these steps:

1. Extract the observed and GCM historical temperatures as vectors (`obs_hist_temps` and `gcm_hist_temps`).
2. Use `ecdf()` from StatsBase.jl to fit empirical cumulative distribution functions to both datasets.
3. Write a function `apply_qqmap_empirical(gcm_temps, ecdf_gcm, obs_hist_temps)` that:
   - For each temperature value, finds its percentile in the GCM CDF
   - Clamps the percentile to the range [0.001, 0.999] to avoid extrapolation
   - Maps to the same percentile in the observed distribution using `quantile()`
4. Apply your function to the near-term data and add a new column `temp_qqmap` to `df_ssp370_near`.
5. Create a QQ-plot comparing observed and GCM quantiles for the historical period, showing the 1:1 line.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Hints

- Use `ecdf_gcm(value)` to get the percentile of a value in the GCM distribution
- Use `quantile(obs_hist_temps, p)` to get the value at percentile `p` in the observed distribution
- The `clamp(x, low, high)` function constrains `x` to the range [low, high]

### Task 4: Compare Methods

Now we compare the delta method and QQ-mapping approaches to understand their strengths and limitations.

::: {.callout-important}
## Instructions

Create a single figure showing monthly mean temperature for the near-term period (2020-2040) using all four approaches:

1. Compute the monthly mean for QQ-mapped temperatures (`near_monthly_qqmap`)
2. Create a figure with 4 lines:
   - Historical observations (`obs_monthly`)
   - Raw GCM near-term (`near_monthly_raw`)
   - Delta-corrected near-term (`near_monthly_delta`)
   - QQ-mapped near-term (`near_monthly_qqmap`)

After creating the plot, examine it carefully and consider:

- How do the two correction methods differ?
- What does the QQ-mapped line reveal about this method's treatment of the warming signal?
:::

```{julia}
# Your code here
```

### Task 5: Reflection

Finally, we reflect on the assumptions, limitations, and appropriate use cases for each bias correction method.

::: {.callout-important}
## Instructions

Write brief responses (2-3 sentences each) to the following questions:

1. **Method selection:** If you were providing climate data to support a decision about urban heat management in Boston, which bias correction method would you recommend and why?

2. **Appropriateness of QQ-mapping:** In the @ines_biascorrection:2006 paper we discussed, QQ-mapping was used to correct both the *frequency* and *intensity* of rainfall for crop modeling. For temperature data, does it make sense to correct the full distribution? Why or why not? When might the delta method be more appropriate than QQ-mapping?
